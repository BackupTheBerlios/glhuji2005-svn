Description:

    We implemented the exercise in Visual Studio under Windows, using an
 MFC based GUI.

Implementation Notes:
   The OpenGLWin class is the main "controller" class called by the GUI,
 it holds a reference to an ArticulatedFigure class.

 	We make use of OpenMesh solely for it's vector class.

Thank you,
Itai, Dagan & Jeremy
