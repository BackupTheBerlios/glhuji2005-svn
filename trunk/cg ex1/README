Description:

    We implemented a particle simulation using the spring model (structural, 
    shear, and flex).
    
    Our solver include Forward Euler, Midpoint and Runge Kutta solvers using 
    fixed stepsizes, and wind (air resistance can also be specified).
    
    All simulatin parameters can be specified in an ascii configuration file, 
    we've included a couple of anotated examples.
    
    Meshes can be of arbitrary size (given enough memory) though in practice
    meshes larger than 32x32 start to act slowly.
    
How to run:
    Clothsim.exe <configurationFile>
    
Controls:
    * esc - quit the simulation
    * w - toggle wireframe/solid view
    * space - stop and then single step through the simulation.
    * enter - restart the simulation after it's been stopped.

Implementation Notes:
    The main particle simulation is contained in the ParticleSystem class, which
stores the particle's position, & velocity as Vector arrays.

    Solvers are subclasses of the NumericalSolver class which contains a method
called calcAccel(), given an array of velocities and positions it calculates the
net accelleration on each particle.  This function is used by all the solvers to
calculate derivatives.

    The Clothloader class is responsible for loading the simulation file and
passing all parameters to ParticleSystem which is then responsible for the 
simulation.

    The ClothView class handles display and user interaction.
