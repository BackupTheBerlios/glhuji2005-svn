# Cloth Data File - all values are MKS

#part one: Mesh Dimensions
MeshWidth = 5
MeshHeight = 5

#part two: Global Constants
Gravity = 9.81

K       = 0.3 #spring constant
B       = 0.2 #damping

#part three: particles
# (u,v)=x,y,z,m,p
# 
# u,v   - place in matrix (zero based)
# x,y,z - particle coordinates in 3d.
# m     - particle mass
# p     - particle isPinned (1/0)
